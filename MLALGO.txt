Major Machine Learning Algorithms:
1. Regression (Prediction)
We use regression algorithms for predicting continuous values.
Regression algorithms:
Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Exponential Regression
Logistic Regression
Logarithmic Regression



2. Classification
We use classification algorithms for predicting a set of itemsâ€™ class or category.
Classification algorithms:
K-Nearest Neighbors
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine
Naive Bayes



3. Clustering
We use clustering algorithms for summarization or to structure data.
Clustering algorithms:
K-means
DBSCAN
Mean Shift
Hierarchical


4. Association
We use association algorithms for associating co-occurring items or events.
Association algorithms:
Apriori


5. Anomaly Detection
We use anomaly detection for discovering abnormal activities and unusual cases like fraud detection.

6. Sequence Pattern Mining
We use sequential pattern mining for predicting the next data events between data examples in a sequence.

7. Dimensionality Reduction
We use dimensionality reduction for reducing the size of data to extract only useful features from a dataset.

8. Recommendation Systems
We use recommenders algorithms to build recommendation engines.
